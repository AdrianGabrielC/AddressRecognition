IQ IQ refers to your intellect and knowledge; this is your innate intelligence, and your ability to grasp, learn, and develop concepts. EQ EQ refers to your mindset and emotional capability; this is your ability to manage the human side of sales with key skills like empathy. XQ XQ refers to processes and execution; this is your ability to embrace operational rigour, discipline in processes, and tactical execution.

What Do Our Clients Think Of Us? Director of Enablement, Immersive Labs I am amazed at how much was accomplished in 3 months. Mentor Group listened intently to what was working and what wasn’t and brought the team so many innovative ideas to uplevel the Sales, Renewal, and CS processes. The training style is very effective, keeping things moving at a steady pace, sharing stories, and really listening when people ask questions to get at the heart of what they are asking. Sales Development Manager, Lenovo I can’t tell you enough how supportive Mentor Group has been over the last few weeks. They have 100% rallied round to not only support, but to think bigger, come up with suggestions, challenge and deliver. It’s felt like a real team effort and I am really appreciative how they have gone the extra mile and owned it. They have always done an excellent job for us, but this was a step further and she certainly delivered. Quality Control Manager, Lonza This program provided helpful material that can be directly and immediately applied not only to interactions with external customers, but internal stakeholders as well.
