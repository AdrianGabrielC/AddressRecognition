Mathews (Exeter) Ltd was established as a company in 1918 by the Mathews family and dealt mainly with the repair of DC electric motors from electric trams, cranes, dragline excavators etc. In 1937 the company was incorporated and became a limited company. After the death of its founder William John Mathews in 1944 the company was run by his widow Mrs Ada Mathews. Ada Mathews decided to put the company up for sale in 1948 and it was sold to William Henry Hallam. He was previously a director of the Midland Dynamo Company of Leicester and had considerable experience in the sale and repair of all types of electrical plant. In 1966 William Hallam's son Martyn Hallam joined the company and on the death of his father in 1985 took over as Managing Director.
