LEARN MORE PATIENT TESTIMONIALS Over the years I have worked with a number of the physios at CSPC, I have found them to be up to date with their thinking and treatments, willing to share their knowledge with one and other and clients. I always recommend CSPC to friends and clients. They have helped hold body and soul together, thank you. I am absolutely delighted with the shockwave treatment I have received at CSPC physiotherapy Clinic and the results it has produced. Each session has measurably reduced the size of my bursitis to the point it has almost gone, with corresponding improvement in my range of movement and comfort in the affected area. It has also ameliorated calcification in my shoulder. A great big thank you to Alison and Julianna for your help! I cannot believe how well I feel. Four years ago, I felt consigned to the ‘rust pile’, today I feel ‘shiny’ and ready for the next challenge. CSPC can seriously alter your way of life …for the better. Within the one hour appointment I received hands on treatment that relieved most of my pain and by the evening I was breathing and moving pain free. By the following morning I was back to ‘full dad duties’ much to the surprise of my partner, who with seeing how quickly I had recovered, started to think I’d made it all up to have a good rest! After a long car journey to Leeds, I arrived with some discomfort in my upper back that worsened over the next day to the point that I could hardly breathe or move without feeling excruciating pain. I’d done a gym session a week or so previously and had felt some discomfort in my back but rested and thought nothing of it. A long car journey combined with caring for two young children resulted in me having excruciating back pain and if it wasn’t for getting an emergency appointment at CSPC physiotherapy clinic I would not have made it home and probably checked myself into A&E! Within the one hour appointment I received hands on treatment that relieved most of my pain and by the evening I was breathing and moving pain free. By the following morning I was back to ‘full dad duties’ much to the surprise of my partner, who with seeing how quickly I had recovered, started to think I’d made it all up to have a good rest! Thanks CSPC physiotherapy for getting me back to my best – super quickly! JACK 4 5 GET IN TOUCH Would you like to enquire about our services? Unsure whether physiotherapy would help?
