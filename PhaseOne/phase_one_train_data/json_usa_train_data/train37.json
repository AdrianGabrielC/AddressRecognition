They aren't selling a bunch of other crap like so many other hardware stores. They have Ace hardware stuff including the largest assortment of the bolts and fasteners and hardware I've ever seen. I didn't really have much time to look around but I will be back and revise my review. Mike Grimm You will not find better customer service anywhere in any business. Everything is always well stocked. If they don't have it then they will order it in front of you and get you an arrival date. Great place. Alan Stevens When I go to a place like this I am usually in a hurry. There is nothing like walking into a store and someone is right there asking you if you need help. They always help me get out so that I can get to my job site. Anthony Bellamy the WHY, HOW, WHO Our why is simple: bring a little more joy to the world of hardware and MRO supplies. We know our manufacturing, construction, and logistics customers have tough jobs, and we are dedicated to making their professional lives a little bit easier, and a little more fun. Our how is more complex. We blend a diverse mix of ideas, design, technology, problem-solving, and people development. Much like a sports team, we value gritty continuous improvement as the cornerstone habit of success. And we don't do this work in isolation, we do this work in collaboration with you, our customers. And finally our who... Our team is composed of car geeks, motorcycle mavens, musicians, Bears/Sox/Cubs/Hawks fans (and their rivals), hobbyists, dreamers, young and old alike. Family people, Single people. Shiny happy people holding hands and laughing. × OK WE LIKE FRIENDS join the miller fan club MUCH ADO ABOUT US About Us Holler at us sales@millerindustrial.com 847-616-8002 Contact Us Mon - Fri - 7am-5pm Sat - 8am-2pm 621 E.
