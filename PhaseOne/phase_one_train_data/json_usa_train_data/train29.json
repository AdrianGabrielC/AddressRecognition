Creative Arts Center ​112 Main Street The former First Lutheran Church on Main Street is providing much needed space for creative endeavors we're hoping to bring to the Battle Lake community. Options include rooms for classes, meetings, culinary, working, and creating; as well as, open areas for dancing, exercising, performing, and socializing—the possibilities are countless. There are spaces for hosting large functions as well as intimate gatherings for purposes to inform, educate and to entertain. This new center will be transformative both for Art of the Lakes as well as the community-at-large. We're always looking for new faces interested in helping us bring this dream to life. ​ Discounts on workshops and performances throughout the year and so much more are reasons why you and your family should belong to Art of the Lakes. JOIN TODAY Creator Spaces First up in 2024, we plan to build out a ceramics studio , a fiber arts studio , a culinary kitchen , and an improved performing arts space . After these initial areas, we hope to add a glass studio, a digital media lab, and an exhibition space in future months. The nascent ceramics studio (to the right of the main entrance) now has a shiny new epoxy floor, plus a donated professional kiln and ceramics tools. We also have a washer / dryer for the fiber arts studio. Yet to come are additional equipment, supplies and electrical / HVAC improvements. As these spaces come online, we'll hold open studio events so you can experience them firsthand.​ Classes Performances BEEKEEPING 101 March 16, 10 - 12 pm IRISH SODA BREAD March 16, 10 - 12 pm Creamed Corn Queen March 23, 11 am ​ Tickets for Creamed Corn Queen performances are complimentary!
