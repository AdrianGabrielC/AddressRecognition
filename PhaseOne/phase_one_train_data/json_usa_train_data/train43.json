Thank You! Thank you to our sponsors, volunteers, parishioners and all friends of the Festival for allowing us to invite the community to “Come Be Greek for the Weekend.” We couldn’t do it without you! About Greek Fest In the early 20th Century, Greek immigrants arrived in Fresno, forming the nucleus of the Greek Community. They established a church, which was officially incorporated in 1923 and St. George’s Church was built on Fresno Street in 1924. Over the years, the community has grown and diversified, celebrating its heritage with an annual Greek Food Festival.
